					<h2 class="section">About</h2>
				  <p>
				  	This is a resource for educators interested in utilizing mapping and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in their curriculum. The ubiquity of modern mapping technologies and their applications across science and society justifies the need to introduce students to this powerful tool for understanding and exploring our world. While not exhaustive, this site contains information and links to resources for learning and teaching GIS and mapping. It is focused on data related to North Carolina but should be applicable to anyone interested in mapping.

				  <p>
				  	A GIS is a computer program for creating, editing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. Any information that has a spatial context (<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Non-Native-American-Nations-Territorial-Claims-over-NAFTA-countries-1750-2008.gif#/media/File:Non-Native-American-Nations-Territorial-Claims-over-NAFTA-countries-1750-2008.gif" target="_blank">state borders</a>, streams, <a href="http://onemilliontweetmap.com/" target="_blank">tweets</a>, etc.) can be used in GIS.

					<h3>GIS Applications</h3>
					<p>
						There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GIS_software" target="_blank">many GIS applications</a> available, some open source and some proprietary. Below is a list of a few popular programs:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html" target="_blank"><strong>QGIS</strong></a> - QGIS stands out as a free and open source application available for all major operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux). It is a powerful system with plenty of mapping functions and is relatively user-friendly (especially for people coming from ArcMap).
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html" target="_blank"><strong>ArcGIS Desktop</strong></a> - ArcGIS Desktop is a suite of programs that allows high-level and low-level map analysis and publishing and is probably the most common proprietary GIS software. It is produced by Environmental Science Research Institute (ESRI). Many collegiate level GIS classes utilize this software and it is used in countless professional fields. All North Carolina K-12 educators should have access to access to free ArcGIS software. Follow this link for more information: <a href="http://www.queens.edu/Academics-and-Schools/NCK12GIS.html">NC K-12 GIS</a>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer" target="_blank"><strong>ArcGIS Explorer Desktop</strong></a> – A free map viewing program produced by ESRI. This program allows for basic map viewing, but is extremely limited when it comes to in-depth analyses and editing. The downloaded version is only available for Microsoft Windows while there is an online version for all operating systems.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.google.com/earth/download/gep/agree.html" target="_blank"><strong>Google Earth Pro</strong></a> – Google Earth Pro is great for viewing data and it does have some rudimentary functions for creating data. Many groups have begun creating map files that fit seamlessly into the Google Earth (.kmz and .kml files). If you search for this type of data online you can find some pretty amazing maps to use in the program. With the Pro version you can also add in a few types of vector and raster GIS data.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 class="section">GIS Data</h2>
				  <p>
						There are two main types of digital map data: vector data and raster data.
				  </p>
					<h3>Vector Data</h3>
					<p>
						Vector data represents geographic data as geometric coordinates (x and y position). A vector data set can consist of either <strong>points</strong> (one coordinate), <strong>lines</strong> (two or more connected, open coordinates), or <strong>polygons</strong> (three or more connected, closed coordinates).
					</p>
					<div class="row thumbnail">
						<div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12 plp">
							<h3 class="text-center">Point</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12 plp">
							<h3 class="text-center">Line</h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-sm-4 col-xs-12 plp">
							<h3 class="text-center">Polygon</h3>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						The most common type of vector data used in GIS is the shapefile. A shapefile is not one file but actually a collection of several files. There are three mandatory files that describe the geometry of the shapefile (.shp), the tabular data associated with the shapefile (.dbf), and an index for moving through the shapefile (.shx), though more may be present (.prj, .shp.xml, .sbn, .sbx, etc.). These files must be kept together in the same directory. <strong>When adding a shapefile to a GIS you will load in the file with the .shp extension</strong>

					  </div>
					</div>
					<h3>Raster Data</h3>
					<p>
						Raster Data is in the form of cells in a grid. Each cell in the grid represents one or more pieces of information (e.g., elevation, color, rainfall, etc.). A photo of Earth from a satellite is an example. If you zoom in close enough you can see the individual pixels (cells) from the image.
					</p>
					<div class="row thumbnail">
					  <div class="col-xs-12">
					    <img src="css\media\RasterEx.png" alt="Raster Image" class="img-responsive center-block"/>
					  </div>
					</div>
					<p>
						There are many raster data formats. A common type is the geoTIFF, a georeferenced image file. Aerial photographs, digital elevation models (DEMs), and land use and land cover are examples of raster data.
					</p>
					<h3>Where to Find GIS Data</h3>
